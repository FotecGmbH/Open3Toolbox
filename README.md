# Open³ Toolbox

Open³ Toolbox stands for Open Software, Open Hardware and Open Data. This toolbox therefore contains a collection of tools that offer the possibility of putting together the right IoT system without significant programming effort.
This is made possible by a modular structure.
Since the problems that can be solved using IoT systems are often similar, many solution approaches can be covered with just a few modules.
Not only are modules available for creating the systems, but also modules for visualizing the collected data.
